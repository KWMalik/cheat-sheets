Share your cheat sheets, collaboratively create cheat sheets, or add any useful free and open source cheat sheets by others.

You are free to choose any free or open source software license for your cheat sheets. If you do choose one, make sure to include a license notice so others are aware of the license.

It's still suggested that you create your own cheat sheets for tests. That way you easily learn the material while writing the cheat sheet. Writing your own cheat sheet also means that it'll support your learning style and focus on the material you want.
If you prefer you can make derivative cheat sheets off of these as long as you follow their accompanying license(s).
